## Setting Up Shopify Payments

Since payment setup cannot be done via CLI, here's the process:

### 1. Through Shopify Admin
1. **Log into your Shopify admin**
2. **Go to Settings ‚Üí Payments**
3. **Find Shopify Payments section**
4. **Click "Complete account setup"**
5. **Follow the verification process:**
   - Provide business information
   - Verify bank account details
   - Submit identity verification documents
   - Wait for approval (usually 1-3 business days)

### 2. CLI Verification
After setup, verify using CLI:
```bash
# Check if setup was successful
shopify store payments --shopify-payments-status

# Verify gateway is enabled
shopify store payments --list-gateways
```

## Alternative Payment Gateways

If Shopify Payments isn't available in your region:

### Popular Alternatives
- **PayPal** - Available worldwide
- **Stripe** - Available in 46 countries
- **Authorize.Net** - US, Canada, UK, Europe
- **2Checkout** - Global coverage
- **Square** - US, Canada, UK, Australia

### Setup Process
1. **Create account with payment provider**
2. **Get API credentials from provider**
3. **Add gateway in Shopify admin:**
   - Settings ‚Üí Payments
   - Find your provider in "Third-party providers"
   - Click "Choose provider"
   - Enter your credentials
4. **Test the integration**
5. **Verify with CLI:**
   ```bash
   shopify store payments --list-gateways
   ```

## Payment-Related Order Information

While you can't configure payments via CLI, you can access payment data from orders:

```bash
# View order with payment details
shopify order view 1234567890 --format json

# Process refunds (payment gateway dependent)
shopify order cancel 1234567890 --refund --amount 50.00
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Payment gateway information requires a paid Shopify plan"
**Solution:** Upgrade your Shopify plan to access advanced payment features.

#### 2. "Shopify Payments not available in your region"
**Solution:** Use alternative payment gateways like PayPal or Stripe.

#### 3. "Setup Required: Yes" in status check
**Solution:** Complete store setup in Shopify admin (Settings ‚Üí General).

#### 4. Gateway showing as disabled
**Solution:** 
- Check gateway configuration in Shopify admin
- Verify API credentials are correct
- Contact payment provider support

### CLI Debug Commands
```bash
# Test API connectivity
shopify config --test-connection

# View detailed shop information
shopify store settings view --format json

# Check API permissions
shopify auth info
```

## Security Considerations

### Why Payment Setup Requires Admin Interface

1. **PCI Compliance**: Payment credentials must be handled securely
2. **Identity Verification**: Payment providers require KYC (Know Your Customer) verification
3. **Legal Agreements**: Payment processing requires accepting terms of service
4. **Regulatory Requirements**: Different regions have specific compliance requirements

### Best Practices

- **Never store payment credentials** in scripts or configuration files
- **Use environment variables** for any payment-related API keys
- **Regularly review** payment gateway configurations
- **Monitor transaction logs** for suspicious activity
- **Keep payment provider contacts** for support issues

## Integration with Automation

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration
```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Check Payment Status
  run: |
    # Verify payment gateways are properly configured
    shopify store payments --list-gateways --format json > payment-status.json
    
    # Check for critical payment issues
    if ! shopify store payments --shopify-payments-status | grep "Enabled: ‚úÖ"; then
      echo "‚ùå Payment gateway configuration issue detected"
      exit 1
    fi
```

### Monitoring Scripts
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# payment-health-check.sh

# Check payment gateway status
if shopify store payments --list-gateways --format json | jq '.payment_gateways | length' | grep -q "^0$"; then
  echo "‚ùå No payment gateways configured!"
  # Send alert to monitoring system
fi

# Check Shopify Payments status
if ! shopify store payments --shopify-payments-status --format json | jq -r '.shopify_payments_enabled' | grep -q "true"; then
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Shopify Payments not enabled"
fi
```
