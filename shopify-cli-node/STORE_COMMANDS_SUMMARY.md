# Store Configuration Commands Implementation

This document summarizes the implementation of Step 9: Store Configuration Commands.

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive store configuration commands under `src/commands/store/` with three main categories:

1. **Settings** - View and update CLI configuration
2. **Themes** - List, upload, and activate store themes  
3. **Webhooks** - List, create, and delete webhooks

## Commands Implemented

### Main Store Command
- `src/commands/store/index.ts` - Main store command with overview of available subcommands

### Settings Commands
- `src/commands/store/settings/view.ts` - View current store settings and configuration
- `src/commands/store/settings/update.ts` - Update local CLI settings

### Theme Commands
- `src/commands/store/theme/list.ts` - List all store themes with filtering options
- `src/commands/store/theme/upload.ts` - Upload theme ZIP files to store
- `src/commands/store/theme/activate.ts` - Activate themes (make them live)

### Webhook Commands
- `src/commands/store/webhook/list.ts` - List all store webhooks with filtering
- `src/commands/store/webhook/create.ts` - Create new webhooks with full configuration
- `src/commands/store/webhook/delete.ts` - Delete webhooks with confirmation

## Key Features

### Settings Management
- View comprehensive store information (shop details, locations, policies, currencies)
- Update local CLI settings (theme, debug mode, log level, auto-update)
- Support for both JSON and table output formats
- Account selection support

### Theme Management
- List themes with role-based filtering and detailed information
- Upload ZIP files with automatic theme creation
- Activate themes with backup functionality
- Preview URL generation
- Role-based status indicators (ðŸŸ¢ main, ðŸ”µ unpublished, ðŸŸ¡ demo, ðŸŸ£ development)

### Webhook Management  
- Comprehensive webhook listing with topic filtering
- Full webhook creation with all Shopify webhook options
- Safe webhook deletion with confirmation prompts
- URL validation and security warnings
- Common topic suggestions and testing tips

### Common Features Across All Commands
- **Multi-account support** - All commands support `--account` flag
- **Output formats** - JSON and table formats for all commands  
- **Error handling** - Comprehensive error messages and validation
- **Progress indicators** - Loading messages and timing information
- **Help text** - Detailed examples and flag descriptions
- **Security considerations** - HTTPS warnings, signature validation info

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- Built using oclif framework (consistent with existing codebase)
- Integrates with existing ShopifyApiClient service
- Uses existing configuration system (configLoader)
- Follows established patterns from other commands

### API Integration
- Leverages existing ShopifyApiClient methods:
  - `settings.*` for shop information
  - `themes.*` for theme management  
  - `webhooks.*` for webhook operations
- Proper error handling and response validation
- Rate limit awareness and API version support

### User Experience
- Informative status messages with emojis
- Helpful tips and next steps after operations
- Security warnings where appropriate
- Related command suggestions
- Confirmation prompts for destructive actions

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Settings
shopify-cli store settings view
shopify-cli store settings update --theme dark --debug

# Themes  
shopify-cli store theme list --role main
shopify-cli store theme upload ./mytheme.zip --activate
shopify-cli store theme activate 123456789 --backup

# Webhooks
shopify-cli store webhook list --topic orders/create  
shopify-cli store webhook create --topic orders/create --address https://example.com/webhook
shopify-cli store webhook delete 123456789
```

## Files Created

```
src/commands/store/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts                 # Main store command
â”œâ”€â”€ settings/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ view.ts             # View store settings
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ update.ts           # Update CLI settings
â”œâ”€â”€ theme/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ list.ts             # List themes
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ upload.ts           # Upload themes
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ activate.ts         # Activate themes
â””â”€â”€ webhook/
    â”œâ”€â”€ list.ts             # List webhooks
    â”œâ”€â”€ create.ts           # Create webhooks
    â””â”€â”€ delete.ts           # Delete webhooks
```

## Build Status
âœ… All commands compile successfully
âœ… TypeScript compilation passes  
âœ… Files generated in dist/ directory
âœ… Ready for use

## Next Steps
- Commands are ready for testing with real Shopify stores
- Consider adding interactive prompts for confirmations
- May want to add webhook verification/testing features
- Could extend theme upload to support directory compression
